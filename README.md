# inTouchChat

Chat made in Python with Tkinter gui. It can be set in LAN as well as in Internet.

To run it just change HOST var in Client and Server ConnectionManager.py to your server IP
```python
HOST = 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' 
```
It is my first "bigger" project in Python. Guess in some time I will look at it with "what happened here" :C

Feel free to use it of course!
